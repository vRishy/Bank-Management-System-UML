# Bank-Management-System---UML

A Bank Management System is a software application that allows a bank to manage its operations and provide services to its customers.
This system is designed to streamline the various banking processes and make them more efficient. 
UML diagrams are commonly used in the development of such systems to provide a visual representation of the system's structure and behavior.
Here is a description of the different UML diagrams that can be used in the development of a Bank Management System. 

## Class Diagram:

Defines the different classes in the system, such as Customer, Account, Loan, and Transaction.
Shows the attributes and methods of each class, such as balance and deposit for the Account class.
Shows the relationships between the classes, such as inheritance, association, aggregation, and composition.
Helps to organize and structure the system's classes and their relationships.


## Use Case Diagram:

Defines the different use cases in the system, such as Create Account, Transfer Money, Apply for Loan, and Check Balance.
Shows the different actors in the system, such as the customer and bank teller.
Shows the interactions between the actors and the use cases, such as association, include, and extend.
Helps to provide a high-level view of the system's functionalities and user interactions.

## Sequence Diagram:

Shows the steps and interactions that occur when a use case is executed, such as creating an account or transferring money.
Shows the different objects involved in the use case and their interactions, such as the Customer object and the Account object.
Helps to provide a detailed view of the system's functionalities and how the different objects collaborate to perform them.

## Collaboration Diagram:

Shows the interactions between different objects in the system, such as the Customer object, Account object, and Loan object.
Shows how they collaborate to perform different tasks, such as applying for a loan or performing a balance inquiry.
Helps to provide a visual representation of the system's object collaborations and interactions.


## State Chart Diagram:
Shows the different states that an object can be in, such as the Open, Closed, or Frozen state of an account.
Shows the events that cause an object to transition from one state to another, such as account closure or fraudulent activity.
Helps to provide a detailed view of the system's object states and transitions.


## Activity Diagram:

Shows the different activities that occur within the system, such as creating an account, transferring money, and applying for a loan.
Shows how the activities are interrelated and the sequence in which they occur.
Helps to provide a high-level view of the system's functionalities and how they are related.


## Deployment Diagram:

Shows the different nodes and components that make up the system, such as the Application Server, Database Server, and Client Machine.
Shows how they are deployed and connected to each other.
Helps to provide a visual representation of the system's infrastructure and its components.


## Component Diagram:

Shows the different components that make up the system and their interfaces and dependencies.
Shows how the different components interact with each other and what functionalities they provide, such as account creation, balance inquiry, and transaction history.
Helps to provide a detailed view of the system's architecture and its components.
